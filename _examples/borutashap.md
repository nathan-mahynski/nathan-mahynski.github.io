Some examples of how to use [BorutaSHAP](https://github.com/Ekeany/Boruta-Shap) to do feature selection on tabular data.  Also, a complete workflow is illustrated, going from initial feature decorrelation and selection to model explanation.

Note that if you are dealing with imbalanced datasets for classification tasks, see [this example](/examples/imbalanced_datasets/) for how to incorporate BorutaSHAP into pipelines which balance the data as part of their pipeline.
