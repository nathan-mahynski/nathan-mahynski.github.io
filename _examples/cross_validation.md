Examples of different types of cross validation and how to use them.  This includes holdout, "vanilla" k-fold, nested, and repeated k-fold CV.  All examples use the scikit-learn library.

This includes a discussion of how to use CV to perform hypothesis testing, for example, to compare the performances of different algorithms.
