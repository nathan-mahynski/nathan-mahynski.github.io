An example of how to use hierarchical clustering on Spearman's rank-order correlation to find decorrelated dimensions (features) in tabular data.  This is based on scikit-learn's example [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance_multicollinear.html), but has been wrapped in classes from my own python package which consolidates many such functions.
