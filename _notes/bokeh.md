This is a living document with notes and examples on using [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) to make interactive visualizations and dashboards.  Bokeh has a nice [tutorial](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bokeh/bokeh-notebooks/HEAD?labpath=index.ipynb) to get started quickly.  The [gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html) also contains many useful code snippets to get going quickly.
