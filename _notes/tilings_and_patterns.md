This [book](https://www.amazon.com/Tilings-Patterns-Second-Dover-Mathematics/dp/B01JO24F9Q) by Gruenbaum and Shephard is an enourmously accessible and systematic treatment of tiling and patterns that provides an excellent introduction to the topic. Here I have abbreviated some notes and main concepts from each chapter which are useful in understanding the application of tilings to the research presented elsewhere on this website. A full reading of the text is highly recommended.
