This [book](https://www.amazon.com/Tilings-Patterns-Second-Dover-Mathematics/dp/B01JO24F9Q) by Gruenbaum and Shephard is an enourmously accessible and systematic treatment of tiling and patterns that provides an excellent introduction to the topic. Here I have abbreviated some notes and main concepts from each of the first 7 chapters which are useful in understanding the application of tilings to the research presented elsewhere on this website. These chapters form what amounts to an undergraduate course on geometry. A full reading of the text is highly recommended as it also includes more modern and advanced concepts which have been built upon greatly since the book's inception in 1975.
