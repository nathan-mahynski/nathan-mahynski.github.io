My name is Nathan A. Mahynski; I received my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Princeton Univ. in 2015, then started my career developing thermodynamic models and simulation algorithms for complex fluids and soft matter systems. My current research focuses on creating predictive models and computational tools, including molecular simulation packages and machine learning pipelines, to understand chemometric patterns in inorganic and biological systems.
