Nathan A. Mahynski received his Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Princeton Univ. in 2015, then started his career developing thermodynamic models and simulation algorithms for complex fluids and soft matter systems. His current research focuses on creating computational tools, including molecular simulation packages and machine learning pipelines, to understand chemometric patterns in inorganic and biological systems to improve the quality of human(oid and coexisting) life(forms).
