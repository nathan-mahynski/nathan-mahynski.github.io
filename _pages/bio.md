My name is Nathan A. Mahynski; I received my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from Princeton Univ. in 2015, then started my career developing thermodynamic models and simulation algorithms for complex fluids and soft matter systems. My current research focuses on creating predictive models and computational tools, including molecular simulation packages and machine learning pipelines, to understand chemometric patterns in inorganic and biological systems.

For a complete list of (hyperlinked) publications, refer to the CV below.  PDFs of all peer-reviewed work are available upon [request](mailto: nathan.mahynski@gmail.com), most of which can also be found on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nathan_Mahynski).

I am an engineer who specializes in designing, developing, and deploying computational tools to solve problems in chemistry and related scientific disciplines. I help researchers in fields like nuclear chemistry, food science, and ecology use machine learning, molecular simulations, and advanced modeling tools to make data-driven discoveries. I also have a long-standing interest in designing self-assembling functional materials. My own research involves using tools from art and architecture in novel ways to program colloidal crystal assembly. I have a PhD in computational Chemical Engineering with a concentration in computational thermodynamics and a certificate in Computational and Information Science. 

Broad research areas include: 
[Thermodynamics](https://nathan-mahynski.github.io/research/using_thermodynamic_extrapolation_to_predict_fluid_properties/), [Material science](https://nathan-mahynski.github.io/research/counting_crystals_in_two_dimensions/), [Food authenticity](https://nathan-mahynski.github.io/research/developing_chemometric_fingerprints_for_ecological_systems/), Machine Learning

Some recent projects include:
* Developing tools for advanced isotope metrology
* Predicting fluid phase thermodynamic properties with deep learning
* Authenticating food labeling claims with chemometric tools 
* Analyzing trends in biorepositories using explainable machine learning
* Identifying materials using nuclear spectroscopy methods
