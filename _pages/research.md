Here you can find longer discussions to accompany ongoing and previous research objectives which tie together different peer-reviewed publications into (hopefully) more coherent, long-term project descriptions. These are written for the scientifically minded, but do not require subject matter expertise. If you find a project or paper interesting, or if you are interested in collaboration or research opportunities, please send me an <a href="mailto:nathan.mahynski@nist.gov">email</a>.
