Here you can find full length discussions accompanying ongoing and previous research projects which tie together multiple peer-reviewed publications into a (hopefully) more coherent description of my long-term research objectives. These are written for the scientifically minded, but do not require subject matter expertise. If you find a project or paper interesting, or if you are interested in a collaboration or research opportunities, feel free to send me an <a href="mailto:nathan.mahynski@gmail.com">email</a>.
