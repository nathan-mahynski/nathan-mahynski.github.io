# Research Opportunities
---

I am currently looking for a postodoctoral candidate to do work on designing self-assembling colloidal systems using symmetry principles at NIST.  There are also new opportunities for undergraduate and high school students who are interested in learning about research in chemical informatics.

1. [NRC Postdoctoral Opportunity](http://nrc58.nas.edu/RAPLab10/Opportunity/Opportunity.aspx?LabCode=50&ROPCD=506461&RONum=C0449&ROBaseMode=R100) You must be a US citizen to apply for this program.  [Contact me](mailto:nathan.mahynski@gmail.com) for details on how to apply!
2. [NIST Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Program](https://www.nist.gov/surf)
  - Bliss Han, 2021, Brown Univ. Environmental Engineering
  - Daniel Markiewitz, 2021, Cornell Univ. Chemical Engineering -> Ph.D. @ Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  - Evan Pretti, 2018, Lehigh Univ. Chemical Engineering -> Ph.D. @ The University of California, Santa Barbara
  - Kamryn Kant, 2018, Clemson Univ. Chemical Engineering
  - Sally Jiao, 2017, 2018, Princeton Univ. Chemical Engineering -> Ph.D. @ The University of California, Santa Barbara

* The [Free Energy and Advanced Sampling Simulation Toolkit (FEASST)](https://pages.nist.gov/feasst/) is a free, open-source, modular program to conduct molecular and particle-based simulations with flat-histogram Monte Carlo methods, primarily developed by Wick Hatch at NIST.

* [PACCS](https://github.com/usnistgov/paccs) is primarily a colloidal crystal structure generation and optimization library written in Python. It supports stochastic optimization of periodic multicomponent systems in two and three dimensions, as well as the generation of candidate structures in two dimensions using wallpaper groups.  It was primarily developed by Evan Pretti as his SURF project in 2018.

Slack and Zoom are indispensable collaboration tools.  I prefer OneNote over alternatives like Evernote for organizing notes, recordings, and other clippings because of its superior integration with the rest of the MS Office ecosystem.  After years of trying tablets and different pens, styli, etc. I was not able to find an electronic handwriting alternative that I found adequate and I still prefer to take notes by hand.  Rocketbook lets you do just that, then scan them with your phone, sending it through OCR to the destination of your choice (such as OneNote).  It also allows to to cast whiteboards in real time.  I've seen a noticeable improvement in focus listening to brain.fm, though it is a monthly subscription service.  Finally, although MS PowerPoint allows you to record your presentation directly in the app, if you use an alternative, or wish to modify/stream/cast other things as part of a pre-recorded presentation, OBS Studio is a great tool typically used by streamers in other industries.

Virtual environments like [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/), [Teooh](https://www.teooh.com/), [Gather](https://gather.town/) also provide interesting alternative work/interaction environments.
