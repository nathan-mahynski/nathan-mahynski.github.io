# tl;dr

USe structure directing agents to program the assembly of colloidal systems.  So you pgogram a machine to do the assembling not the part itself.

# Polymers As Structure Directing Agents

Stuff from grad school

So polymer topology and interaction with the colloid can be used to program the assembly into different similar packings. How can we go further?

Use grants/papers/presentations etc.

# Symmetry-Derived SDAs

In the previous work, we used polymers as SDAs to select between polymorphs (different crystals) that were similar in thermodynamic stability.  But what if I want to make a completely different structure from scratch?

## Rings as SDAs

## Derivable Functionality
