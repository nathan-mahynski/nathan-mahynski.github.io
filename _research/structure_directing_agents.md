# tl;dr

Structure directing agents (SDA) are typically small molecules added during the synthesis of materials which control their growth; for example, by templating channels and controlling aspect ratios in zeolites. However, SDAs can more broadly be envisioned as any additive which tunes, or even fully programs, the assembly of some structure.  Under this definition, [chaperones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperone_(protein)) could be considered SDAs for protein folding. 

In this body of work we reconsider the role of additives in colloidal mixtures which serve such a role in tuning their (self-)assembly (text available upon [request](mailto:nathan.mahynski@gmail.com) if you cannot access them):

Colloidal materials generally derive their utility from how their constituents are arranged, rather than from the chemistry of what they are made of, so SDAs are particular useful for engineering these systems.  Generally, colloidal systems rely on top-down or bottom-up assembly strategies.  Top-down approaches, such as lithography, are often limited "below" by resolution limits and/or "above" by scalability concerns.  Bottom-up strategies, like tuning the surface chemistry or shape of the colloid, require that the colloid itself be mutable.  But what if we wish to make a material out of proteins, antibodies, or quantum dots?  The chemistry of these building blocks can be impart (desired) functionality in the final material, but not necessarily if the modifications are too severe.  Moreover, practical issues involving synthesis also limit experimental realization.

SDAs represent a third assembly paradigm.  The SDA is essentially an assembly machine that we program instead of the parts themselves. 

# Polymers As Structure Directing Agents

## Depletion

Depletion is an effective force between surface induces by the exclusion of a depletant, like a polymer from between them

Long history starting with Ao in the 1950 s

Used to induce aggregation and crystallization

## The Difference Between FCC and HCP

Very small
assumed that FCC better than HCP

Under AO assumptions the polymer is integrated out and ignored

## The Polymer Matters After All
Stuff from grad school

So polymer topology and interaction with the colloid can be used to program the assembly into different similar packings. How can we go further?

# Symmetry-Derived SDAs

In the previous work, we used polymers as SDAs to select between polymorphs (different crystals) that were similar in thermodynamic stability.  But what if I want to make a completely different structure from scratch?

Q: from G&S - how can you create a tile that can carry any pattern?  Only answer this question partially, a more complete answer is subject of ongoing research

## Isohedral Tiles are SDAs for Symmetry

Orbifolds describe symmetry
Cut open orbifolds to get IH tiles
Tiles = core (colloid) + boundary.
Boundary = derivable!

## 2D Math in a 3D World

We need to be careful - some practical considerations
