Heesch's syetme expanded to [A]TCG.

Motivate that disassembly is FD = E^2/G so that assembly pathways are just FD*G = E^2

<!--
2D Crystallographic Tiling

# Heesch Types
Escher
Heesch Tiles - 28 tiles from certain wallpaper groups

# Fundamental Domains from Orbifolds

Conway's symbols on circles - "shortcut" method to get FD for groups

# Fundamental Domain Tilings

Can find all 46 FDs for groups by making transformations in the plane.

# Non-FD Tilings

The other 47 "molecular" units.

-->

This means something very important - instead of thinking of groups as matrices, we can vied them as "rings" decorated with maps that indicate how parts of the ring are related to each other.  Create ring, add decorations until "cost" reaches a threshold. this is what conway proved.


# Mutiple Tiles

First examples of when actually NOT multiple tiles, just looks like multiple images but is single motif.
This illustrates r-hderal tilings

Conversely, k-isohedrail tilings would seem to require "multiple" programming. by def then have symmetry ops NOT identical to that used globally.

anisohedral tilings?


address isohedral vs. r-hedral
