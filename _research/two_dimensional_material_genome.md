# The Inorganic Gene

Mackay and paper in 2017 by Delgado, OKeefe, etc. to describe Systre key

# Symmetry in 2D

## Crystals and Fundamental Domains

FD is smallest piece of puzzle

## Isohedral Tilings 

Some IH are FD and some are not

## Orbifolds

Fold up FD, actually shape is unique, so reversing enumerates all IH tiles!
Some IH tiles are not FD
O = E/G as quotient space

Show cutting of 3*3 from slides

Show gifs of "Snakes on a Euclidean Plane"

## The Magic Theorem

# An Artistic Aside

## Heesch and Kienzle

Motivated to study how many ways to cover the plane with interlocking shapes
Useful for manufacturing
Perhaps motivated by Hilbert's work on mono/isohedral tilings

## M.C. Escher's Brand of Magic

His system was different, but mathematicians consider it the closest to Heesch's system. almost the same, and independently derived.

# A Little Logic

Expanding Heesch' system - othes did but not with [A]TCG

Approximate methods

# Conclusions









Motivate that disassembly is FD = E^2/G so that assembly pathways are just FD*G = E^2

FD = atomic i.e. indivisible from (global) symmetry perspective - IH tiles are a superset of FD's which may not be indivisible, so are "molecular analogs"

explaining how to draw lines:
REmark that orbifold means that "curved edges in flat plane" = "straight lines on curved surface" much like Einstein's theory of frame dragging

show that JPCA boundaries are all just convenient cuttings of the orbifolds!

Connection of "rotational diffusion" to Itajime shibori by C. Yackel

<!--
2D Crystallographic Tiling

# Heesch Types
Escher
Heesch Tiles - 28 tiles from certain wallpaper groups

# Fundamental Domains from Orbifolds

Conway's symbols on circles - "shortcut" method to get FD for groups

# Fundamental Domain Tilings

Can find all 46 FDs for groups by making transformations in the plane.

# Non-FD Tilings

The other 47 "molecular" units.

This means something very important - instead of thinking of groups as matrices, we can vied them as "rings" decorated with maps that indicate how parts of the ring are related to each other.  Create ring, add decorations until "cost" reaches a threshold. this is what conway proved.




First examples of when actually NOT multiple tiles, just looks like multiple images but is single motif.
This illustrates r-hderal tilings

Conversely, k-isohedrail tilings would seem to require "multiple" programming. by def then have symmetry ops NOT identical to that used globally.

anisohedral tilings?


address isohedral vs. r-hedral
