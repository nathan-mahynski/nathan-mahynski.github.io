# tl;dr

Data-science needs lots of data; quality can be less than perfect if the trends come through for screening.

# Thermodynamic Extrapolation

What is it, and what else has been done.

# Computationally Efficient Exploration

T-extrap

Multicomponent

# Examples

Film wetting
Stuff with Matt

# Optimal Combination

Jacob's Work

# Extrapolating Structural Observables

Sally's work

# Future Work

Mention Ward's work so far as first order
Other people have reached similar conclusions and used similar results to explore water behavior.
