# tl;dr

Data-science needs lots of data; quality can be less than perfect if the trends come through for screening.

In general, doing screening of anything (drugs, optimiation of molecules, perturbations, etc.)

list papers

# Thermodynamic Extrapolation

What is it, and what else has been done.

# Computationally Efficient Exploration

T-extrap
mu-extrap
t-mu extrap
Multicomponent

# Examples

Film wetting
Stuff with Matt

# Optimal Combination

Jacob's Work

# Extrapolating Structural Observables

Sally's work

Mention Ward's work so far as first order

Jeppe Dyre
Iso-structural stuff

Other people have reached similar conclusions and used similar results to explore water behavior.

# Extrapolating other types of Simulations

Hatch - mayer sampling MC, and also parameters in U(r)

# Future Work
