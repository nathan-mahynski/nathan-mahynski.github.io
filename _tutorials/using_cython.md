This is very brief summary of [Cython](https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and how to use it to quickyl accelerate pure python code.  Cython is much more adaptable than what I discuss below; I have chosen to focus primarily on how you can use it to accelerate code written in pure python, usually during the course of prototyping.  This allows you to use your code in production for research much more easily.

In fact, if you are writing scientific code and working with numerical computations, [numba](/tutorials/using_numba/) often allows to accelerate code even more easily.  I recommend you check that out first.
